- garden is not the right shape for my phone. also the first habit is in th emiddle of the screen instead of top left
- make transitions between pages smooth
- the main issue is that the my iphone se on both web and mobile is not formatted correctly. most things dont fit well on the screen
- need to git commit a working version of the app
- A complete sound system. this is a later feature
- refine animations, images, icons, etc.

Later:
- add custom commands to antigavity like /debug, /refactor
- need to find someone to expedite me using phone ui and giving you suggestions/fixes based on what i see 
- home page is ugly
